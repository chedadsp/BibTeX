The key challenge in delivering such WSN architecture is the trade-off between the cost of wireless sensors and acoustic analysis complexity. In this paper, we are proposing a source traffic modelling considering a system in which sensors are connected to a cloud based processing service. Acoustic sensing in practice generates great amount of traffic, and therefore a new model of sensing in a reverberant environment is necessary for better understanding of traffic nature and its volume. To lower the sensor cost, we have considered low-complexity acoustic event detection on the sensor side for preventing unnecessary traffic. The proposed acoustic sensor acts like a noise gate. Sound propagation in reverberant environment is modelled using the modified Image-Source Modelling (ISM) method. The source traffic model is validated in Matlab simulation and in real reverberant environment. Results show an example of bandwidth used by a simple acoustic sensor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOI: &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.5755/j01.eee.21.5.13335&quot;&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.5755/j01.eee.21.5.13335&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;}, number={5}, journal={Elektronika ir Elektrotechnika}, author={Cetic, Nenad B. and Popovic, Miroslav V. and Djukic, Miodrag M. and Kovacevic, Jelena V.}, year={2015}, month={Oct.}, pages={64-68} }
