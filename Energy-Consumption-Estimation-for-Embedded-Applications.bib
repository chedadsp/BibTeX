The lack of accurate and suitable methodology for energy consumption estimation for embedded applications based on ultra-low power heterogeneous multicore DSP platforms inspired a solution that will be presented in this paper. The solution has been developed as a plugin for the Eclipse based MIDE (Multicore Integrated Development Environment), in order to facilitate production of energy efficient firmware solutions. Evaluation of energy loss has been calculated using instruction-level power analysis, virtual platform, debug information, and diverse input loads. The primary goal was to obtain a precise model of energy consumption that will establish a direct link between program solutions and the amount of energy required for their execution, whilst processing different input loads. Estimation has been validated against empirical data, measured on a real DSP platform. Results show that very high accuracy has been reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOI: &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.5755/j01.eie.22.3.15313&quot;&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.5755/j01.eie.22.3.15313&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;}, number={3}, journal={Elektronika ir Elektrotechnika}, author={Krunic, Momcilo V. and Popovic, Miroslav V. and Krunic, Vlado M. and Cetic, Nenad B.}, year={2016}, month={Jun.}, pages={44 - 49} }
