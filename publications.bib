 abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;Energy consumption,
 indeed,
 represents one of the essential properties of embedded applications,
 especially for those devices whose autonomy depends on battery life. The lack of accurate and suitable methodology for energy consumption estimation for embedded applications based on ultra-low power heterogeneous multicore DSP platforms inspired a solution that will be presented in this paper. The solution has been developed as a plugin for the Eclipse based MIDE (Multicore Integrated Development Environment),
 in order to facilitate production of energy efficient firmware solutions. Evaluation of energy loss has been calculated using instruction-level power analysis,
 virtual platform,
 debug information,
 and diverse input loads. The primary goal was to obtain a precise model of energy consumption that will establish a direct link between program solutions and the amount of energy required for their execution,
 whilst processing different input loads. Estimation has been validated against empirical data,
 measured on a real DSP platform. Results show that very high accuracy has been reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOI: &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.5755/j01.eie.22.3.15313&quot;&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.5755/j01.eie.22.3.15313&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;},

DOI={10.5755/j01.eee.21.5.13335},
abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;Recent research efforts show that Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) for acoustic sensing have the potential for ubiquitous sensing. The key challenge in delivering such WSN architecture is the trade-off between the cost of wireless sensors and acoustic analysis complexity. In this paper,
we are proposing a source traffic modelling considering a system in which sensors are connected to a cloud based processing service. Acoustic sensing in practice generates great amount of traffic,
and therefore a new model of sensing in a reverberant environment is necessary for better understanding of traffic nature and its volume. To lower the sensor cost,
we have considered low-complexity acoustic event detection on the sensor side for preventing unnecessary traffic. The proposed acoustic sensor acts like a noise gate. Sound propagation in reverberant environment is modelled using the modified Image-Source Modelling (ISM) method. The source traffic model is validated in Matlab simulation and in real reverberant environment. Results show an example of bandwidth used by a simple acoustic sensor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOI: &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.5755/j01.eee.21.5.13335&quot;&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.5755/j01.eee.21.5.13335&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;},

  abstract={Keeping vehicle in the right track while driving is common task for humans, as they perceive lane lines with ease. Naturally, one of the essential tasks for autonomous vehicle would be to detect lane lines. Except for using them as constant reference in steering controller, they are used as inputs in other driver assistance functions like lane departure warning, for example. Different road and weather conditions make it difficult to detect lane lines, as marking can become indistinct or disappear. Many simple vision-based algorithms rely on detection of edges of the markings with Canny edge detection and previously mentioned problems can affect proper extrapolation of lanes. This paper also belongs to vision-based group of algorithms that use camera. It presents usage of color thresholding to detect lane edges and together with perspective transformations and Hough transform to extrapolate lane segments in image with controlled conditions. These conditions include straight road and sunny weather. We used OpenCV computer vision framework that supports mentioned functionalities and algorithms, with Python, to obtain and compare results.},

  abstract={Autonomous driving systems rely on accurate and reliable lane detection to safely navigate roads. In this paper, we propose a method for improving lane annotation in autonomous driving data sets using classical computer vision techniques. The proposed method combines the Hough transform and linear curve fitting to detect and smooth the positions of lane markings in a video stream. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on the Berkeley DeepDrive (BDD) dataset and compare it to the ground truth annotations. Results show that the proposed method achieves a high level of accuracy and robustness in lane detection, and can effectively improve lane annotation in autonomous driving data sets. Our method provides a valuable tool for training and evaluating autonomous driving systems, and can also be applied to improve annotation in different datasets.},
