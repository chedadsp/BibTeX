  abstract={In this paper we give a concept of a device that provide voice interface (VI) for issuing commands and receiving messages. Proposed device is designed having Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm in mind and connected to the internet via IEEE 802.11. It uses Google speech to text (STT) and text to speech (TTS) web services for voice analysis and synthesis. Hardware prototype description is given in detail. Key aspects like price, performance, memory footprint and energy consumption are analyzed on a case study. We discuss potential applications when such a device is deployed as an interface of home automation system.},
